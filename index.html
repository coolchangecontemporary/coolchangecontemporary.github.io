            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    Cool Change is an artist-run initiative based in Boorloo <em>(Perth)</em>, Western Australia. Since
                    our
                    inception, we have hosted exhibitions, artist residences, performances, workshops, talks, and
                    operated a small shop. Volunteer-led and not-for-profit, the organisation is committed to presenting
                    critically engaged artistic practice in a welcoming and accessible environment with an agile and
                    responsive outlook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are planning to recommence operations in 2023 both onsite and offsite. Two phrases signify our
                    approach to recommencement:

                    <p>
                        From what we have learnt over the last four years about volunteer-led arts organisations, a slow
                        roll
                        approach is needed to sustainably and strategically renew our operations. We need to remain
                        responsive
                        to
                        changes and currents surrounding us, while also maintaining an agile structure that can adapt
                        and
                        bend
                        to
                        account for the needs of the emerging and experimental practices that Cool Change is designed to
                        support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cool Change should shrink and expand where needed, taking time to recoup, listen and breath as
                        desired.
                        To
                        recommence at a <em class="ff-italics">slow roll</em> pace is to account for the capacities of
                        our
                        volunteer team and those
                        around
                        us.

                        The nature of space and site is an important variable for arts organsations. As a collective, we
                        are
                        driven
                        by a resourceful and responsible approach to space and site, which does not take for granted the
                        opportunity
                        to operate on the unceded lands of Whadjuk Noongar people, and recognising our place as settler
                        artists
                        and
                        workers on this land.

                        What is the impact emerging volunteer arts organisations have had on property, community and
                        inner-city
                        lifestyle, and how has this impact been considered and remunerated by resourced and established
                        businesses?
                        This is an open question and a demand for the labour of emerging artists, writers, curators and
                        workers
                        to
                        not be taken lightly. Cool Change is reconsidering the ubiquity of the white-cube and the impact
                        this
                        has
                        had on potential for exhibition-based arts organisations to emerge.

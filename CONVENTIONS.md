## CSS

- Class names like `whatever-this-format-is` - i.e. all lowercase, hyphens between words

## VAIN/VANE URCHIN

- option A: take an SVG of the existing shape and simply render it, no fun included
- option B: 
    - hook the urchin up to some form of time - a calendar, a countdown (to the launch date of the YB?) - and vary the length of each pylon based on the current value
    - *urchin pylon*.

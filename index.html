                <p>Cool Change is an artist-run initiative based in Boorloo (Perth), Western Australia. Since our
                    inception, we have hosted exhibitions, artist residences, performances, workshops, talks, and
                    operated a small shop. Volunteer-led and not-for-profit, the organisation is committed to presenting
                    critically engaged artistic practice in a welcoming and accessible environment with an agile and
                    responsive outlook.</p>

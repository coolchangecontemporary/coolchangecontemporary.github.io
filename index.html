            <p>We acknowledge that this is and always will be Aboriginal land, and that our capacity to engage in
                creative practice on this boodja is informed by the knowledge and labour of First Nations People.</p>

                <p>Cool Change is an artist-run initiative based in Boorloo (Perth), Western Australia. Since our
                    inception, we have hosted exhibitions, artist residences, performances, workshops, talks, and
                    operated a small shop. Volunteer-led and not-for-profit, the organisation is committed to presenting
                    critically engaged artistic practice in a welcoming and accessible environment with an agile and
                    responsive outlook.</p>

                We are planning to recommence operations in 2023 both onsite and offsite. Two phrases signify our
                approach to recommencement:
            </p>
            <div class="slowroll">
                <p>Slow roll</p>
                <p>
                    From what we have learnt over the last four years about volunteer-led arts organisations, a slow
                    roll
                    approach is needed to sustainably and strategically renew our operations. We need to remain
                    responsive
                    to
                    changes and currents surrounding us, while also maintaining an agile structure that can adapt and
                    bend
                    to
                    account for the needs of the emerging and experimental practices that Cool Change is designed to
                    support.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cool Change should shrink and expand where needed, taking time to recoup, listen and breath as
                    desired.
                    To
                    recommence at a <em class="ff-italics">slow roll</em> pace is to account for the capacities of our
                    volunteer team and those
                    around
                    us.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="AsIs">
                <p>As is</p>
                <p>
                    The nature of space and site is an important variable for arts organsations. As a collective, we are
                    driven
                    by a resourceful and responsible approach to space and site, which does not take for granted the
                    opportunity
                    to operate on the unceded lands of Whadjuk Noongar people, and recognising our place as settler
                    artists
                    and
                    workers on this land.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is the impact emerging volunteer arts organisations have had on property, community and
                    inner-city
                    lifestyle, and how has this impact been considered and remunerated by resourced and established
                    businesses?
                    This is an open question and a demand for the labour of emerging artists, writers, curators and
                    workers
                    to
                    not be taken lightly. Cool Change is reconsidering the ubiquity of the white-cube and the impact
                    this
                    has
                    had on potential for exhibition-based arts organisations to emerge.
